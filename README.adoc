= c.py

`c.py` is replacement for cat. c.py is written in a few lines of Python code
and provides automatic syntax highlighting with pygments. Paging support is
provided by a shell wrapper called `c`. See the manpages
https://docs.sevenbyte.org/c.py/c.1.html[`c(1)`] and
https://docs.sevenbyte.org/c.py/c.py.1.html[`c.py(1)`] for more information. A
short introduction can be read
https://blog.sevenbyte.org/2016/05/15/cat-with-syntax-highlighting.html[here].

== Install

On Arch Linux there is an https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cpy[AUR package]
available. `c.py` can be installed using your favorite AUR helper, such as
https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur[pacaur].

----
$ pacaur -S cpy
----

If you like installing the script the hard, manual and *unsupported* way you
can just drop the `c.py` and `c` files somewhere into your `$PATH`. Make sure
that the https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main[pygments] library is
installed for python3.
