c.py
====

c.py is (not yet) a drop in replacement for cat. c.py is written in a few lines
of Python code and provides additional features, for instance automatic synthax
highlighting with pygments and paging support. See the manpage c(1) for more
information.

Install
-------

pip can be used to install c.py from pypi:

    $ [sudo] pip install [--user] c.py

Use either "sudo" to install c.py system wide or "--user" to install it in
"$HOME/.local".
