c.py
====

c.py is replacement for cat. c.py is written in a few lines of Python code and
provides automatic syntax highlighting with pygments. Paging support is provided
by a shell wrapper called c. See the manpages c(1)[1] and c.py(1)[2] for
more information. A short introduction can be read here [3].

Install
-------

On Arch Linux there is an AUR package[4] available. c.py can be installed
using your favorite AUR helper, such as pacaur[5].

    $ pacaur -S cpy

If you like installing the script the hard, manual and *unsupported* way you can
just drop the `c.py` and `c` files somewhere into your `$PATH`. Make sure that
the pygments[6] library is installed for python3.
